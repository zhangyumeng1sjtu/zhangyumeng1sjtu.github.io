Tn*3* family transposons are a widespread group of replicative transposons, notorious for contributing to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance, particularly the global prevalence of carbapenem resistance. The transposase (TnpA) of these elements catalyzes DNA breakage and rejoining reactions required for transposition. However, the molecular mechanism for target site selection with these elements remains unclear. Here, we identify a QLxxLR motif in N-terminal of Tn*3* TnpAs and demonstrate that this motif allows interaction between TnpA of Tn*3* family transposon Tn*1721* and the host β-sliding clamp (DnaN), the major processivity factor of the DNA replication machinery. The TnpA-DnaN interaction is essential for Tn*1721* transposition. Our work unveils a mechanism whereby Tn*3* family transposons can bias transposition into certain replisomes through an interaction with the host replication machinery. This study further expands the diversity of mobile elements that use interaction with the host replication machinery to bias integration.
