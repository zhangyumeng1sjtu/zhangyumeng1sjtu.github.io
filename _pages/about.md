Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Monash University.

I am supervised by Prof. [Jiangning Song](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/jiangning-song) and Prof. [Tony Purcell](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/anthony-purcell). Standing at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and Biomedicine, I am working on developing cutting-edge computational biology approaches to  tackle fundamental immunology questions like T cell receptor-antigen recognition.

Before traveling to Austrlia, I obatined my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majoring in Bioinformatics. Guided by Prof. [Hong-Yu Ou](https://bioinfo-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/), my postgraduate research focused on mining secreted effectors from Gram-negative bacterial genomes. I also worked as a research intern at [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]() in 2021.
